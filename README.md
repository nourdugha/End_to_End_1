# Notes (Data Ingestion):
1- To configure local dataset from your local disk you have to change the config.yaml file by make the use_local_data is true &  local_data_file: artifacts/data_ingestion/data.csv instead of local_data_file: artifacts/data_ingestion/data.zip

2- If you want to download the dataset from external URL you have to config two things make the  use_local_data is false &  local_data_file: artifacts/data_ingestion/data.zip
